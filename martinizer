#---martinizer: detect Java code changes that are not covered by unit-tests.
#
#   "The Martinizer" is named in honor of both the dry-cleaning process
#   ("One Hour Martinizing" [tm]), and "Uncle Bob" Martin, author of 
#   the wonderful book "Clean Code".  It uses 'git' and 'Jacoco' to
#   find said changes.
#
#   The Martinizer assumes:
#      1. You are in the top-level directory of a checked-out-from-git
#         Java project.
#      2. Your source directories end in "/java/" followed by the 
#         package structure (e.g. "src/main/java/com/mycompany").
#      3. You have the hash of the earlier commit you want to compare to.
#      4. You have just run the unit-tests with Jacoco code-coverage
#         turned on, and run the Jacoco report with HTML output.
#         The output must be in a sub-directory called "coverage".
#
#   The Martinizer then compares the git log of the current check-out
#   with the earlier hash, and cross-references it with the Jacoco output.
#   It then displays (on stdout) the lines that have been added or changed 
#   that are NOT fully covered by unit-tests.
#
#   This script depends on the separate Java project TheMartinizer,
#   which must have been built into a jar and deployed in the same
#   directory as this script.  (It just reformats the git output into
#   a more useable format.)
#
#   If your project has "sub-projects" underneath it, you may also
#   specify the space-separated list of sub-projects you want to examine
#   on the end of the martinizer command line.  If you only specify the
#   old hash, then the Martinizer looks at everything in the project
#   that is a java file.  (It ignores unit-test classes: see ClassChangeRecord
#   in TheMartinizer project for details.)
#
#   This script is released as "open source", as part of the entire TheMartinizer
#   package.  See the LICENSE file for details.
